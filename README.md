### Disaster Relief Coordination Platform :rescue_worker_helmet:

Welcome to the Disaster Relief Coordination Platform, designed to facilitate assistance and support during natural disasters. Our system allows citizens to request help or offer assistance, while rescuers efficiently coordinate missions to fulfill these needs.

#### Aim
The aim of our platform is to create a collaborative system for registering and servicing assistance requests in communities affected by natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes. Citizens can indicate their specific needs for items like water, food, or medicine, as well as offer surplus items for donation.

#### Features
- **Map Display**: Rescuers can view all requests and offers on a map interface, enabling efficient mission planning and execution.
- **Mission Management**: Each vehicle can undertake one or more missions for receipt or delivery of items.
- **Mobile Accessibility**: Citizens can access the platform from their mobile devices to state their needs or offer assistance.
- **Announcements**: The base can announce needs for items in short supply, which are displayed on citizens' mobile phones.
- **User Roles**: The system accommodates three types of users: Administrator (base), Rescuer, and Citizen.
